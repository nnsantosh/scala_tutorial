# Data Structures

## Arrays (Mutable)
Arrays preserve order, can contain duplicates, and are mutable.

scala> val numbers = Array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
numbers: Array[Int] = Array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

updating element of array:
scala> numbers(3) = 10

## Lists (Immutable)
Lists preserve order, can contain duplicates, and are immutable.

scala> val numbers = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
numbers: List[Int] = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

Cannot update element of list
scala> numbers(3) = 10
<console>:9: error: value update is not a member of List[Int]
              numbers(3) = 10
  
## Sets (Immutable)
Sets do not preserve order and have no duplicates

scala> val numbers = Set(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
numbers: scala.collection.immutable.Set[Int] = Set(5, 1, 2, 3, 4)

## Tuple (Immutable)
A tuple groups together simple logical collections of items without using a class.

scala> val hostPort = ("localhost", 80)
hostPort: (String, Int) = (localhost, 80)
Unlike case classes, they donâ€™t have named accessors, instead they have accessors that are named by their position and is 1-based rather than 0-based.

scala> hostPort._1
res0: String = localhost

scala> hostPort._2
res1: Int = 80
Tuples fit with pattern matching nicely.

hostPort match {
  case ("localhost", port) => ...
  case (host, port) => ...
}
Tuple has some special sauce for simply making Tuples of 2 values: ->

scala> 1 -> 2
res0: (Int, Int) = (1,2)

## Maps (both Mutable and Immutable map is available)
It can hold basic datatypes.

Map(1 -> 2) <br />
Map("foo" -> "bar") <br />
This looks like special syntax but remember back to our discussion of Tuple that -> can be used to create Tuples. <br />

Map() also uses that variable argument syntax we learned back in Lesson #1: Map(1 -> "one", 2 -> "two") which expands into Map((1, "one"), (2, "two")) with the first element being the key and the second being the value of the Map. <br />

Maps can themselves contain Maps or even functions as values. <br />

Map(1 -> Map("foo" -> "bar")) <br />
Map("timesTwo" -> { timesTwo(_) }) <br />

### Operations in Class mutable.Map <br />

### WHAT IT IS	WHAT IT DOES <br />
### Additions and Updates: <br />
ms(k) = v	(Or, written out, ms.update(x, v)). Adds mapping from key k to value v to map ms as a side effect, overwriting any previous mapping of k. <br />
ms += (k -> v)	Adds mapping from key k to value v to map ms as a side effect and returns ms itself. <br />
ms += (k -> v, l -> w)	Adds the given mappings to ms as a side effect and returns ms itself. <br />
ms ++= kvs	Adds all mappings in kvs to ms as a side effect and returns ms itself. <br />
ms put (k, v)	Adds mapping from key k to value v to ms and returns any value previously associated with k as an option. <br />
ms getOrElseUpdate (k, d)	If key k is defined in map ms, return its associated value. Otherwise, update ms with the mapping k -> d and return d. <br />
### Removals:	<br />
ms -= k	Removes mapping with key k from ms as a side effect and returns ms itself. <br />
ms -= (k, l, m)	Removes mappings with the given keys from ms as a side effect and returns ms itself. <br />
ms --= ks	Removes all keys in ks from ms as a side effect and returns ms itself. <br />
ms remove k	Removes any mapping with key k from ms and returns any value previously associated with k as an option. <br />
ms retain p	Keeps only those mappings in ms that have a key satisfying predicate p. <br />
ms.clear()	Removes all mappings from ms. <br />
### Transformation:	<br />
ms transform f	Transforms all associated values in map ms with function f. <br />
### Cloning: <br />
ms.clone	Returns a new mutable map with the same mappings as ms. <br />
