# SCALA TUTORIAL
Scala basics and functional programming concepts to remember

## Why Scala
Scala shines for big data processing and machine learning

## Reasons
1. Functional paradigm and scripting approach
2. Concise and expressive.
3. Apache spark is another compelling reason to learn scala.

## SBT (The Simple Build Tool)
Its a build tool for scala projects
Sccala projects follow same structure as java projects
Main Project folder <br/>

  build.sbt <br/>
  src <br/>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;main <br/>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;java <br/>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scala <br/>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resources <br/>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;test <br/>  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;java <br/>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scala <br/>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resources <br/>
          
 Notice that sbt definition is in build.sbt file similar to pom.xml in a maven project
To compile and run the project the command used is : sbt run from the main project folder

You can also use scala REPL(read-print-eval-loop)
run the command: sbt console
It will start scala REPL or interactive scala shell or you can think it as scala commmand line interpreter.
Scala REPL supports experiment driven development.
Whenever you start your sbt console in a project scope SBT will compile your project and bring all the source code and dependencies into current scope.

Scala is a hybrid language it supports functional programming and object oriented programming.
